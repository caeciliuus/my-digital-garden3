- **Author name**: Gaius Valerius Catullus
- **Dates** (including BCE or CE): 84 BCE – 54 BCE
- **Genre(s) of writing**: Lyric poetry emphasizing a devotion to leisure, culture, poetry, love, and more intimate/personal events
- **What works of his will we read?** Poems
- **Title of one or two other notable works:** Poems
- **Comment on the author’s style (what he is known for?**)Catullus is known for affections, passions, and hatreds, highlighting the small moments in life à similar to the naturalist movement in the U.S during the late 19th century. Compared to other writings at the time, Catullus’ work contained much explicit sexual imagery.  He keeps his poems short and lively, with a wide range of expressions and emotions throughout his works, using “Catullus” of the poem as a persona.
- **Why is he important?** While Catullus isn’t one of the Roman writers commonly used to help students learn Latin, his use of humor and satire, as well as his spontaneousness and lightheartedness influenced the future of Latin poetry. Specifically, Catullus’ use of humor and satire were adopted by many later writers.
- **Did he influence any later writers? Explain**. Catullus had significant influence on poets during the Augustan age such as Virgil, Pliny, and Martial. This influence can be seen in his use of powerful emotions and his focus on personal emotions. After the Augustan age, Catullus was seemingly forgotten about, and scarcely known in the Middle Ages.
