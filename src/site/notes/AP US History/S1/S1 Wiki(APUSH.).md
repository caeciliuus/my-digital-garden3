## Chapter 1: The Colonial Era

#### Spanish model of colonization
  - Crown rules colonies autonomously
  - Men comprise most of the colonies & take native women as their wives
#### Columbian Exchange
  - Europe → Americas: smallpox, domesticated animals, sugar, wheat, rye
  - Americas → Europe: corn, potatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, peppers, cacao
![Pasted image 20230112201845.png](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230112201845.png)
- ==Treaty of Tordesillas:==  split new world between Spain & Portugal
- ==Encomienda:==  economic colonial system tying Natives to land owned by colonizers
- ==Syncretism:==  practice of connecting Christianity to native religions
- ==Black Legend:==  banned the use of enslaving natives in the colonies, causing Africans to be used instead
- ==House of Burgesses:==  first colonial congress
{ #78b565}

#### English Reformation
  1. Martin Luther creates list of problems in the church, primarily sale of indulgences
     - ==Covenant of grace:==  protestant belief that one can go to heaven only if they believe in God
  2. ==Henry VIII==  creates Church of England so he can get a divorce
  3. Elizabeth I is tolerant of other faiths, brings reformation to the church
  4. Stuart Cousins ==James==  & ==Charles I==  seceded Elizabeth
     - No religious tolerance, believes in divine right of kings → begins Great Puritan migration
  5. Puritans that stay in England rise to overthrow Charles & begin the English Civil War. Charles is overthrown
  6. ==Charles II==  begins restoration, gives US land to his supporters (proprietorship)
  7. James II takes power after Charles II dies w/o an hear. Glorious revolution begins (James dips → France) & constitutional monarchy is created
  - ==Puritans:==  wish to get rid of Catholic influence, no more iconoclasm, separate from government, elect members of Church
- ==John Winthrop:==  first governor of New England, created the model of Christian charity
  - Created idea that the Puritans are in a deal w/ God: he let them survive the journey over so they must be the best Christians possible for him (or hell will come?)
- ==Manifest Destiny:==  American territorial policy stating it was the people's duty to settle, conquer and prosper throughout the continent. 
{ #13767f}

- Roger Williams buys RI, which he turns into a community based on religious tolerance, receives protection from English govt.
- ==Mercantilism:==  economic theory with heavy government involvement/stewardship in the economy. States that the world's wealth is finite: one nation gains, another loses 
{ #bb44b6}

  - England sets this system up 2 ways: used colonies for cheap, raw materials then overcharge them for finished goods
- Mercantilism created the ==Atlantic Trade==  → USA sends cheap materials to England, receive overly-expensive manufactured goods in return 
  - Slavery supports the trade: slaves, the materials they produce and the materials they require to survive are all traded
- Decrease in indentured servants available because **(1)** there's competition of where they will move and **(2)** England sends less indentured servants to the colonies
- ==Bacon's Rebellion:==  pivot point, marks the movement from indentured servants → African slaves. Indentured servants and slaves team up to burn Jamestown to the ground. Results in the government creating a race-based hierarchical system that'll prevent slaves from revolting 

![Triangular Trade | 500](https://cdn.britannica.com/12/189412-049-D5A55A4F/flow-triangular-trade-Europe-slave-goods-North.jpg?w=740&h=416&c=crop)

#### Steps taken to develop precept of black inferiority
  1. Establish black inferiority
  2. Establish white superiority
  3. Enforce the notions publicly
  4. Enforce notions via theology
#### Navigation Acts
  - Set of rules created in England to restrict colonies from having a free economy [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^bb44b6  \|(Mercantilism]]) sh colonial merchants & ships can trade within colonies
  2. Certain BNA goods can only be traded within empire
  3. All foreign goods imported into colonies must step into English part to be traded
  4. ==Vice Admiralty Courts==  created → those who were tried for smuggling were forced to be in an English court w/o a jury. Violates the Magna Carta  
  - Colonies don't follow the rules so James II makes all the colonies into one large royal charter: ==The Dominion of New England==  
  - James is overthrown, making his daughter, Mary, & son-in-law, William of Orange, the rulers. They end the Dominion

#### Colonial culture
  - ==Enlightenment era:==  time when European thinkers challenged traditional views by applying scientific method
    - Rational reason understanding 
  - ==John Locke:==  **(1)** ==Tabula Rasa:==  essay concerning human understanding: no human is born innately good or sinful, we are a blank slate **(2)**  ==Two Treatises of Government:==  people should come together and form a social contract to create a government. Whole purpose of government is to protect <u>lives, liberty and pursuit of property</u> 
#### Great Awakening
  - Rejection of rationalism @ the heart of enlightenment
  - Schism: ==Old Light==  (traditional Protestant branches) v. ==New Light Churches==  (emotional release into evangelical birth) 
  - Consequences: pluralism (divisions), challenge traditional thought </span>, put emotion over learning, undermine recommended wisdom, dissent from consensus
- ==Glorious Revolution:==  James II was overthrown b/c he taxed cider without voter knowledge & converted to Catholicism
  - William & Mary agree to constitutional monarchy, create a bill of rights
- ==King William's War:==  fought in Europe but also America between French & English → first world war  
- ==Salem Witchcraft Crisis:==  reaction to the change happening in the colonies, Puritans believed it was punishment for breaking the covenant. Causes women to be targeted for "witchcraft" 
- ==John Peter Zenger Case (1795):==  newspaper editor arrested for incl. an article criticizing NY governor → results in freedom of press 
- ==Stono Rebellion (1739):==  enslaved Africans gathered and went around killing landowners b/c they were made to work on feast day 
  - Raises concern about future rebellion, causing more laws to be created against slaves
#### French & Indian War
  - English need more land to grow crops & support increasingly growing population, so they look to OH. But PA, DE, and Dutch want it.
  - ==Albany Congress==  is called to hopefully ally w/ Iroquois, create Plan of Union to coordinate attacks, and an intercolonial govt.
    - ==Plan of Union==  says we should have royal governor in addition to intercolonial assembly. This doesn't work
  - Despite having the natives on their side, the French lose & give up all their NA continental holdings to the English, causing them to double their debt. ==Treaty of Paris==  ends war 
    - Colonists get secure borders
    - Spain gets NE but loses FL
    - Natives can't play European powers against each other
  - ==Proclamation Line of 1763== : boundary line drawn along headwaters, marking the British American Colonies. Pisses off all the squatters

## Chapter 2: The Revolutionary Era

#### Real vs. Virtual Representation
  - Colonists believe their representation is drawn from the constituency it represents: ==real representation== . They believe parliament can't represent t hem b/c they don't know needs or wants of individual colonies.
  - English believe that every member of parliament represents everyone in the empire: ==virtual representation==
- ==Real Whig ideology:==  powerful governments are dangerous, especially ones led by a monarch (republicanism!)
#### Revenue Acts (+ Currency Act)
  - ==Sugar act:==  reduced pre-existing 6 pence tax on molasses to 3 pence and will strictly enforce it (vice admiralty courts). This act was codified b/c colonists wouldn't pay pre-existing tax and would just bribe the customs officer 
  - ==Currency acts:==  outlawed colonial issues of paper money 
    - Colonial perspective: believe they could not maintain vigorous economic activity w/o their own currency
    - English perspective: English merchants were getting underpaid in colonial currency
#### Stamp Act
  - ==Stamp Act==  required tax stamps on printed materials, violators tried in Vice Admiralty Courts 
  - ==Loyal 9:==  Boston artisans' club, hung effigy of Andrew Oliver & burned his brother-in-law's house on fire
  - ==Sons of Liberty:==  group that organized protests against England so no one's house is burned down again
  - ==Nonimportation associations:==  groups of colonial merchants that refused to import colonial goods
  - Stamp act is repealed but ==Declaratory Act==  is passed: legal for England to tax the colonies whenever they want 
#### Townshend Acts
  - Charles Townshend creates a series of acts, ==Townshend Acts== , that violate mercantilism (colonies can just buy their own shit) 
    1. Tax on items imported from Britain: glass, lead, paper, tea
    2. Parliament pays provincial officials
    3. Open additional vice-admiralty courts
  - ==Daughters of Liberty==  formed
- ==Boston Massacre:==  Boston sees an increase in redcoats and tension breaks out between the guards & protestors. 5 die
- ==Tea Act:==  passed in response to the East Indies Company going bankrupt, makes the East Indies Company the sole provider of tea to the colonies. Angered colonists b/c they saw it as England trying to monopolize the colonies 
  - Results in the ==Boston Tea Party:==  colonists pretend to be natives and force themselves on a boat, then destroy all the tea in Boston Harbor
#### Coercive (intolerable) Acts
  - Passed to punish the colonists for resistance 
  1. ==Boston Port Act:==  port of Boston is closed until the British are compensated for the destroyed tea
  2. ==MA Govt. Act:==  replace governor elected by assembly with one apptd. by king, also no town meetings
  3. ==Justice Act:==  someone accused of murder in attempts to suppress a riot will be transported to a court outside the colonies
  4. ==Quartering Act:==  colonists must provide housing for British troops if needed → allows England to isolate revolutionaries
  5. ==Quebec Act:==  draws Quebec's boundary line further South, forcing colonists to go to Quebec (ew) to get land. Catholicism also allowed in Quebec
#### Continental Congress
  - First continental congress since Albany congress
  1. Define American Grievances
  2. Develop a plan for resistance
  3. Figure out a constitutional relationship w/ GB
  - Articles of Association/Continental Association
    - Nonimportation, nonexportation, nonconsumption
    - ==Committees of Observation and Inspection==  created to ensure that colonists are practicing nonimportation/exportation/consumption
- ==Lexington & Concord:==  British military try to siege Lexington & Concord but Paul Revere spreads the message. Moment that disagreement became war  
- ==Siege of Boston:==  British seized Boston but quickly withdrew  
#### British assumptions about war
  - Patriot forces can't withstand trained British military
    - Hire German mercenaries from Hess (Hessians)
  - Capturing major cities will result in the end of the war
  - Military vic roy = political vic roy
#### Second Continental Congress
  - Called to consider ministry's response to Continental Association
  1. De Facto government → extralegal; not illegal but not protected by law
  2. Printed money, foreign affairs, created a navy, strengthened militia, hired GW
  3. Olive Branch Petition: "if George III knew what was happening, he'd take their side" → NO LOL
  - Government needs legitimacy - Articles of Confederation; Continental Congress - Confederation Congress
#### Varieties of republicanism
  1. Classical: republics don't work when they're large, virtuous, led by a natural aristocracy of merit. Small republic means more are represented
  2. Economic: virtue doesn't last long, rational self-interest is inevitable, pursuit of private interests
  3. Egalitarian: govt. needs to respond to the needs of ordinary folk
- ==Patriots==  make up 2/5 of population: local merchants, members of dominant protestant groups, Chesapeake gentry,..
- ==Loyalists==  make up approx. 1/3 to 2/5 of population: ethnic minorities who want protection from British, tenant farmers, Anglican ministers,..
#### Major battles of the Revolutionary War
  1. ==❗Lexington & Concord== : moment @ which disagreement turned to war  
  2. ==❗Bunker Hill== : British attack in which Americans are dug in at top. Resulted in British withdrawal from Boston  
  3. ==Trenton/Princeton:==  Americans snuck on Hessians on Christmas, then on NYE

       - ==Treaty of Amity & Commerce:==  France recognizes America as a nation, allows trade 
       - ==Treaty of Alliance:==  no independent diplomacy, must work together 
       - Becomes a global war: Netherlands w/ US & Spain w/ France (they want Gibraltar)
  5. ==❗Southern Campaign:==  British campaign attacking Southern colonies  
     - ==King's Mountain== : major setback for British southern strategy
     - ==Cowpens== : slowed British efforts to attack North Carolina
     - ==Guilford Court House== : militia, known to be weak, that caused a victory & huge loss of British life
  6. ==Battle of Yorktown:==  Cornwallis surrenders to focus on Jamaica  
#### Treaty of Paris of 1783
  - Treaty ending the war 
  - Ambassadors Ben Franklin, John Jay & John Adams were told to let France handle the negotiations but France didn't want to end the war, they wanted Gibraltar for Spain
  - ==Articles 4 & 5:==  allowed Britain to collect previous debt. Problematic as the federal government can't enforce taxes, only colonies 
    - Return loyalist land (this doesn't happen)
#### Confederation Congress
{ #ef1486}

  - One house, no power to regulate foreign trade, enforce laws, or tax, approval of 9 states required to enact laws, 13 states need to approve amendments to the Articles, no executive branch, no national court system
  - Main focus was foreign affairs, currency & postage system
  - Britain, France, Spain restrict trade for young US w/ Caribbean holdings. Didn't think they could handle their population
#### NW Territories
  - ==Northwest Ordinance of 1784:==  established a government for the NW territories, outlined process for admitting a new state into the Union.
  - Lands in NW territories were surveyed → townships 6 sq. mi. 36 sections, 640 acres each, $1 min price per acre
  - ==Bill of Rights, 1787==  guaranteed freedom of religion, right to jury trial, no cruel or unusual punishment, no slavery (but if a slave was caught escaping, they must return)
- ==Mount Vernon Convention (VA/MD)== : called to discuss navigational rights in common waterways → inspired collaboration
- ==Annapolis Convention:==  amend the articles to allow govt. to deal w/ crisis. Not many delegates come so the PA Convention is called to increase federal power
- ==Shay's Rebellion:==  armed uprising b/c MA raised taxes b/c legislators wanted to collect securities. Results in more delegates present @ PA Convention 
#### Philadelphia Convention
  - ==VA Plan:==  presented by Edmund Randolph but written by Madison; "large state plan"
  - ==New Jersey Plan:==  William Patterson, "large state plan"
  - ==Connecticut Compromise:==  "great compromise" - Roger Sherman
  ![[Plans of government.canvas]]

{ #a5a8a0}

- Intl. slave trade cannot be prohibited for at least 20 yrs
- ==Fugitive Person's Clause:==  any state is required to return a fugitive back to where he (or she) came from
- ==Domestic insurrections clause:==  all states are required to help prevent or end a (slave) rebellion
#### Ratification 
  - ==Federalists:==  younger men who believed in constitution, not concerned about tyranny 
  - ==Classical Republicanism:==  belief stating that civil virtue must be learned. Religious moral based laws
  - ==Antifederalists:==  older citizens expressing a great concern that the constitution could create tyranny: Anglicans, backcountry farmers, Sam Adams, Patrick Henry,.. 
    - Heirs of the Real Whigs
    - ==Bill of Rights:==  document stating the guaranteed rights of freeborn Americans cannot be revoked
  - VA & NY are 2 states who voted against ratification. Ratification could still pass but 2 states w/ biggest economies not ratifying is significant
- ==Revenue Act:==  5% import duty → raise import tax, particularly on England so citizens can buy cheaper domestic goods
- Madison doesn't think a Bill of Rights is necessary but is forced to do it. Believes in explicit govt. 
- ==Loose interpretation:==  loose understanding of the constitution → if it doesn't say you can't, you can
- ==Strict Interpretation:==  clearing up misconceptions about judiciary branch. No cap on # of justices
  - 1 Supreme Court
  - 3 Appellate courts (now 13)
  - 13 District courts (94 now)

#### Washington's Cabinet, Hamilton's plans
- Alexander Hamilton created =="Report on Public Credit, 1790"==, analyzing financial standing of U.S, made recommendations to recover from post-war debt 
  - Can't repudiate its debt b/c no one would loan money to the govt.
  - Going to redeem all the debt at **full face value,** then assume state debt & pay it @ full face value

| **Position**          | **Name**         |

| Attorney General      | Edmund Randolph  |
| -                     |                  |
#### First party system
{ #6b915b}

  - Characterized by a lack of grass root organization → started @ top and slowly moved down
  - Hamilton's fiscal policies divide congress from one party system → two
{ #35c565}

    -  ==Federalists:==  led by Hamilton & supported by Washington & John Adams. Support federalism & new financial system
    -  ==Democratic Republicans:==  led by Madison & Jefferson. Hate the financial system, supported by Antifederalists

| Democratic Republicans                           | Federalists                                                   |   |

## Chapter 3: The Early Republic
- U.S is in awk position due to the French Revolution - need to pick a side
#### First political party system
  - ==Jay’s Treaty== : U.S is pissed at England because they: **(1)** haven’t withdrawn from the Great Lakes (violating article 4), **(2)** didn’t pay for the slaves they liberated, **(3)** seizing American vessels & cargo, **(4)** impressing American sailors (forcing them into the British navy) → “once a British subject, always a British subject”. John Jay becomes Ambassador for England, creates treaty: 
    1. England withdraws from Great Lakes
    2. Pay for depreciations against American shipping
    3. Create tributary that England won't attack U.S ships, still doesn't stop the harassment; U.S not reimbursed for cost of runaway slaves
    4. Grant U.S trading privileges in UK
  - Leads to: **(1)** tensions w/ France **(2)** completely partisan vote → all federalists vote for it, no Democrats vote for it **(3)** War of 1812
- ==Pickney Treaty:==  treaty giving states permission to trade through the Mississippi River → "if you won't vote for Jay's Treaty, you can't vote for Pickney treaty" 
- ==Election of 1796:==  runner up in the election was VP
#### Foreign affairs
  - 🇫‍🇷 fucks w/ 🇺‍🇸 and seizes their ships. U.S ambassador comes to France but is refused #foreignAffairs
  - ==XYZ Affair:==  3 US diplomats meet 3 French diplomats, who immediately ask for a bribe. This pisses off the 🇺‍🇸 → nickname the French diplomats "agent x/y/z" #foreignAffairs
  - ==Quasi War==  between America & France ensued. Not much conflict, just a series of naval battles in the Caribbean → France loses  
  - ==Convention of 1800:==  ends the Franco-American alliance, unbinding the countries from each other 
#### Alien & Sedition Acts
  - Federalists pass a series of acts to keep immigrants out of the U.S b/c they make up the majority of Democratic Republicans
    1. ==Naturalization Act== : extends number of years to become a resident in the U.S to 12 years
    2. ==Alien Acts== : make it legal to imprison or exile enemy aliens
    3. ==Sedition Act== : cannot utter anything false, scandalous, or malicious about the government (violates freedom of speech 😟)
  - ==Virginia & Kentucky Resolutions:==  states have federal power to nullify a state's act within their borders. Jefferson & Madison make a pact in VA and KE to do so → ==nullification==
    ![[party split DR, F.canvas]]
- ==Republican Motherhood== : argument that women hold a crucial role in society - they raise the next generation of virtuous citizens → they need education 
- ==Judith Sargent Murray== : key proponent in the fight for women’s education. Argues that women are of interior intellect since the beginning of time - uses example of Adam and Eve’s
- ==Abigail Adams==  pushes for more political inclusion but only talks to her husband John Adams → “Abigail’s Letters to John”. Highly educated
- Property owning women in New Jersey could vote in elections from 1776-1807
- ==Coverture== : when a men and a woman get married, the two become one and the women loses her identity 
{ #c325c6}

- ==Gradual emancipation== (NY, PA, NJ, DE): after a certain debt, any child born into slavery will be freed on their next birthday
{ #ca33f8}

- ==Voluntary Manumission== (VA, DE, MA): a slaveowner can choose to free slaves but they must relocate out of state
- ==Fries Rebellion:==  congress taxed land, houses and legal documents to fund Quasi War 
- ==Gabriel's Rebellion:==  VA blacksmith, march on Richmond → plot uncovered ahead of time 
- ==The (election) revolution of 1800:==  first peaceful exchange of power between two political parties in U.S history
- ==Jefferson/Burr vs John Adams/Charles Pinckney== : Jefferson & Adams tied and it goes to House of Reps → Jefferson wins & Democratic Republicans have control of the executive branch 
- New treasury secretary is ==Albert Gallatin==  → drops Hamilton's financial plan and attempts to pay off debt by 1817 but doesn't succeed b/c of the War of 1812
  - Federalists "retreated to the Judiciary" → ==midnight appointments== : John Adams stays up all night before Jefferson takes office, commissioning  Federalist party members as judges
#### Judicial Review 
{ #aa572d}

  - ==Marbury v. Madison== :  William Marbury sued Madison for declining to certify him to justice in District of Columbia. Federalist supported Supreme Court 
    - Marshall ruled that Marbury had a right to the appt,  but the SC couldn’t make Madison honor it, so Marbury didn't get it. Established the SC's greater power to judge constitutionality of laws passed by congress → called ==Judicial Review==  
    - This gave the judicial branch a lot of power
#### Louisiana Purchase
  - Jefferson buys a lot of land, incl. New Orleans, from France w/ the goal of using New Orleans as a sugar refinery from Haiti. Export goods through Port of New Orleans #foreignAffairs
  - Napoleon gives U.S the land for $15 million, but the constitution doesn't explicitly state whether this is allowed (and Jefferson's morals)
  - ==Lewis & Clark Expedition:==  2 men explore the land bought b/c France didn't tell them about the boundaries
- Intl. slave trade ends in 1808 → ==African American Abolitionist Societies==  emerge (PA, NYC, MA)
  - ==American Colonization Society:==  Jefferson, Madison, Monroe. They were **not abolitionists**
#### Further Foreign Affairs (Quagmire?)
  - British kept impressing American citizens so the U.S retaliated
  - ==Non-Importation Act== : banned the import of British goods but exempted cloth and metal items → doesn't work b/c those are Britain's 2 biggest exports to the U.S #foreignAffairs 
  - ==The Chesapeake Affair:== U.S.S Chesapeake is stopped by a British ship, who seize 4 men and hang 1. Angers the government greatly
    - Responded w/ the ==Embargo Act==  → the U.S won’t export anything to anybody; exports decline by 80% #foreignAffairs
  - ==Non-Intercourse Act of 1809== : ends trade with Britain and France #foreignAffairs
  - ==Macon’s Bill #2== : if England stops being a dick, the U.S will side with England; if France stops being a dick, the U.S will side with them #foreignAffairs
    - Both France & Britain say that they’ll stop (both lying), and the U.S sides w/ France and declares war on England (US wins)
  ![[war of 1812.canvas]]
#### The War of 1812
  - Shipbuilding races on the Great Lakes, burning down capitals & white houses
  - Fort Baltimore and Francis Scott Key
  - ==Treaty of Ghent==  - Status Quo: treaty ending the war 
    - Pivoted the U.S to be considered as a nation
    - Shift from agricultural to market economy
    - Birth of the one party system
  - ==Hartford Convention:==  the end of the national arena for the Federalists (end first party system, begin Era of Good Feelings)
    - Federalists want an amendment to reduce the power of the federal government
    - Also want to reduce the power of VA → a president can't come from the same state twice in a row
  - ==Era of Good Feelings:==  first depression caused by the creation of a capitalistic economy
#### Early industrialism
  - ==Boston Manufacturing Company:==  Francis Cabot Lowell sketched British textile factories from memory and brought all phases of textile manufacturing together
  - Boarding houses for workers in Lowell MA. American industrialists envisioned America industrializing w/o the poverty and degradation seen in Europe
- Boarding houses for workers in Lowell MA. American industrialists envisioned America industrializing w/o the poverty and degradation seen in Europe
#### Era of Good Feelings
  
  - End of the first party system
  - Lack of partisan discord (until 1824..)
  - Limits to how good you can feel when ...
  - ==Panic of 1819==  (bank failures) 
  - ==Missouri Compromise== : Henry Clay put forward a compromise in 1820: ME & MO will both join union, MO as a slave state, maintaining balance between slave & free states. Slavery prohibited forever north of MO’s border
{ #86bca6}

    - Almost unravels when MO submits a constitution barring blacks from entering the state
- Pre-industrial → mixed economy
- ==Inside/outside societal structure:==  men did all the outdoor work (fields, herding, firewood, fishing, hunting); women did the “inside” work (gardens, milking, chickens, spinning, weaving, preserving food, meals, cloth, childcare)
- When the means of production leave the home, the traditional workers leave with it. Women go to weave, men go to factories
- Factories used a “==outwork system== ” for women → owners give the women cloth before they leave & if they come the next day with clothes ready, they get $
- ==Slater & Lowell== : Americans who see the factories in England, draws pictures of all the machinery, then brings it back to the U.S. Puts all the means of production under one roof 
- At the ==Hartford Convention,==  Federalists look to limit the power of the federal government, especially the South's power and its ability to declare war 
- After the war, the flip/flop continued and the now Democratic Republicans wanted to strengthen the federal government
#### Henry Clay's American System  
{ #820330}

  1. National bank → ==Second Bank of the United States==
  2. International improvements to connect the nation → only part of this system that doesn't pass
  3. ==Tarif of 1816:==  tariff to protect manufacturing #foreignAffairs
     - Stimulate N.E economy while South & West’s agricultural products would feed N.E mills and workers. Goods would move in all directions, natl. bank would handle transactions
  4. Madison enacted much nationalist programs: ==Second Bank of the U.S==
- ==National Road:==  ran 130 miles between Cumberland MA, & Wheeling VA - later extended to OH
- ==Eerie Canal:==  linked Great Lakes to Atlantic seaboard
- ==Calhoun's Bonus Bill== : earmarks the revenue "bonus" as well as future dividends, from the recently established Second Bank of the United States. Vetoed by Madison
- Marshall court & power of the federal government
  1. Strengthened the court's position as a coequal with the legislative and executive branches of the government
  2. Established the court's power of [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^aa572d\|judicial review]] in the political system
- ==McCulloch v. Maryland== : Maryland tried to tax a branch of the national bank, who refused then sued → states cannot tax the federal gov

- ==Monroe Doctrine== : U.S will stay out of European affairs as long as Europe doesn't colonize South or North America. Created by John Adams #foreignAffairs
#### Panic of 1819
  - As European countries recovered from war & weather, they grew their own food & Britain's' laws established a high tariff on imported food, raising demand for American agricultural products
  - Foreclosures & unemployment down in city & countryside 
| North                                 | South                                  |

#### Separate Spheres Ideology
  - First workforce out the door is women, then the growing middle class follows. No longer indoor/outdoor work; redefined what it meant to be a family 
    - Men: public sphere, provide and protect families. Men responsible for capitalism, public life, cyclical economy
    - Women: private/domestic sphere, moral compass and guardians, nurtured and guarded the family’s morality. Women are responsible for the country’s morals, the home, raise & educate children
  - Home moves from being a **center of production** →  **center of consumption** →  results in shrinking families but childhood becomes longer (as it becomes separated from production; avg. age of marriage was pushed back
  - _Previously_: republican motherhood, politicized women’s traditional roles → _Now_: resubmerge women in the home, women raise the next generation of virtuous citizens
## Chapter 4: Antebellum
#### 2nd Great Awakening
  - **what led to the second great awakening?**  The Second Great Awakening was a religious revitalization movement in the United States during the early 19th century. It began around the 1790s and lasted until the 1840s. The movement was fueled by a sense of spiritual disillusionment among some parts of society, a reaction to the Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason and science over faith. The Second Great Awakening was characterized by widespread revivals and conversions, an emphasis on personal piety and religious experience, and an increased interest in social reform. It also led to the formation of new Protestant denominations, such as the Mormons and Seventh-day Adventists.

- ==Immediatists== : believe that slavery should be abolished immediately & use moral suasion to do so → act of persuading a person or group to act in a certain way through rational thinking
#### Election of 1824
  - ==Democrats:==  Members of the party that emerged from Jefferson’s Republican Party as one of the two dominant parties in the second party system 
  - The Adams wing emerged as the National Republicans, and the Jacksonians became the Democrats; as an insurgent political force, they immediately began planning for 1828
  - As president, Adams proposed a strong nationalist policy incorporating Henry Clay’s American System, a program of protective tariffs, a national bank, and internal improvements.
  - Adams believed the federal government’s active role should extend to education, science, and the arts, and he proposed a national university in Washington, D.C.
  ![2nd political party system](2nd%20political%20party%20system.canvas)
  - 2nd party system characterized by lots of voter turnout b/c states removed property qualification
#### King Andrew I
  - Elected in 1829
  - Believes he is the heir to Jefferson → says he wants a “smaller government” but weakens the judicial & legislative branches
    - Used more vetoes than any other president combined
    - Doesn’t use White House cabinet, instead he uses his friends → called “kitchen cabinet”
    - Spoils system: replaced appointed officials w/ men who supported him
    - Ignores Supreme Court decision in **Cherokee/Worcester v. Georgia** and removes natives from *their* land
> [!Nullification Crisis]
> - ==Virginia & Kentucky Resolution/Calhoun’s “Exposition and Protest"==: Calhoun builds on the resolutions, argues that states can nullify legislation they don’t believe it’s constitutional. Jackson doesn’t like this
> 	- ==Webster Hayne Debate== : Hayne (represents Calhoun) argues for immediate access to western land so that slavery can expand, Webster disagrees. Becomes a debate of slavery → Webster wins
> - South claims that the North can’t regulate slavery, says they can nullify laws if they want
> - ==Tariff of Abominations (1828):==  sought to protect northern and western agricultural products from competition with foreign imports but NC doesn’t argue against it because they hope Jackson will reverse it #foreignAffairs
> - ==Tariff of 1832== : set to reverse some of the effects of the Tariff of Abominations so NC nullifies both tariffs #foreignAffairs
> - Jackson to pass a ==Force act== , which would force SC to pay using the military. Causes Calhoun to resign his role as VP & join senate
> - Congress suggests to use the navy
- ==Dueling toasts== : Jackson speaks against nullification while Calhoun (his VP) supports it at the same dinner. Causes a ruckus
- ==Compromise Tariff of 1833== : both Calhoun and Clay create the Compromise Tariff of 1833 → reduces tariffs over 10 year period
  - Charter to expire in 1836: recharter early to embarrass Andrew Jackson, who doesn’t want a bank → plan backfires on Clay, Andrew Jackson vetoes the recharter & the public supports him
    - BUS notes circulated as national currency & could be redeemed for gold and silver. Bank acted as a clearing house for state banks, refusing to accept bank notes of any local bank that lacked sufficient gold reserves
  - ==Pet Banks== : one bank in each state to be the depository of federal funds 
  - ==Deposit Act of 1836== : provided for the distribution of the federal surplus to the states in proportion to their population. You have to pay with gold & silver
  - Creates land bubble, which pops, then causing recession
#### Election of 1832
  - Democrats → Jackson & Van Buren
{ #f6cdb9}

    - Jacksonians denounced the Bank of the United States as a vehicle for special privilege and economic power
  - National Republicans → Clay and John Sergeant
    - Republicans supported the Bank of the United States  as a pillar of their plan for economic nationalism
- ==Deposit Act of 1836:==  Authorizing the secretary of the treasury to designate one bank in each state and territory to provide services formerly performed by the B.U.S.
- South develops new defense of slavery: pivots from "necessary evil" to "positive good" defense 
  - ==Necessary evil== : slavery is evil and bad but necessary for life in the South. Rev. Peter Fontaine: "land is cheap and plentiful while labor is scarce and expensive, so slavery is necessary"
  - ==Positive good== : paternalism, slave owners are the father while slaves are the grandchildren. Response to the North's reforms during the 2nd Great Awakening
    - Often called ==apologists==
    - George Fitzhugh – "Apologist": article defending African slavery
- ==Task system== : each slave was assigned a specific task to complete for the day. After they finished, their time was their own (BARELY MORE HUMANE)
- ==Nat Turner's Rebellion:==  slave rebellion against whites in VA. 60 whites killed in 48 hours → as many as 20 slaves killed in reprisals
#### Indian Removal
  - U.S was initially accommodating to the natives
  - In GA, there was an area belonging to Cherokees that they don't wanna give up (there's gold). Cherokee has a rule saying they don't have to sell their land but govt. makes them 
  - ==Indian Removal Act:==  federal funds for relocations (3/5 clause gave South power in the government)
#### Cherokees & Marshall's court

  - ==Cherokee Nation vs Georgia (1831):==  Backed by sympathetic whites but not by President Andrew Jackson, the Cherokees under Chief John Ross turned to the federal courts to defend their treaty with the United States 
  - Neither a foreign nation nor a state, but Cherokee have a right to their lands
  - ==Worchester v. Georgia== : Marshall defined the Cherokee position more clearly. The Cherokee nation was a distinct political community in which “the laws of Georgia can have no force” and into which Georgians could not enter without permission or treaty privilege 
  - Distinct political community
> [!Trail of Tears]
> - The Choctaw went first: they made the forced journey from Mississippi and Alabama to the West in the winter of 1831 and 1832
> - Natives relocated to Oklahoma - find gold & oil there
{ #5ae16c}

- ==Metropolitan industrialization== : when the piecework is sent to the home (in a city) to be completed by the next day → tenement sweatshops
- Commercialization of farming: need to be able to produce food w/ significantly lessened workforce → "agriculture remained the northern economy's backbone"
  - Mechanization: sowers, reapers, iron, steel plows
- Women send out all kinds of reformatory pamphlets via the mailing system (Andrew Jackson does not like this - bars them from using the USPS)
- ==American and Foreign Antislavery Society== : women removed from the movement, methodology of making changes within politics power
- William Lloyd Garrison & The Liberator created the ==American Anti-Slavery Society==  → controlled by women but inherently racist, use moral suasion to convince slaves to stop
#### Democrats v. Whigs
{ #49bf0a}


  - In the 1830s, remnants of the National Republicans & Anti-Mason parties come together to become the Whigs
  - Whigs pushed for industrial & commercial development within the nation's current borders. 
    - Vision of economic expansion demanded an activist govt., while Democrats reaffirmed the Jeffersonian principle of limited government. Also supported corporate charters, a natl. bank & paper currency.

- It is the country’s [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^13767f \|manifest destiny]] to expand the cotton → the term is coined
- USA is invited by Mexico to move into Texas, maintain duel citizenship. Mexico **(1)** allows them to use slavery, ****(2)**** can self-govern themselves. #foreignAffairs
  - US citizens want autonomy, so they revolt against the Mexican government & became independent → USA won’t annex it because no one wants to be on record supporting the expansion of slavery in the region
  - Polk runs for president, promises to buy California, take all of Oregon and a bit more, then annex Canada. If he gets the presidency, he’ll complete all these things, then won’t run for re-election as long as he gets everything he wants
- Polk gets Oregon (Oregon Treaty), then annexes Texas, then Mexico finally sells California to the USA #foreignAffairs
  - Polk provokes a war against Mexico, causing America to invade Mexico, where they take Mexico city
#### Mexican War: 1846 - 1848
  - ==Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo== : US gains CA, NM, present day NV, UT, AZ, parts of CO and WY 
  - US paid claims to US citizens of $ 3.2 million (U.S citizens in Texas who have claims against Mexico for property damage),  $15 million to Mexico
  - ==Slave power conspiracy== : North believes this is evidence that slave powers in the South hold too much power in the government → in congress, judicial, executive. Concentration of slave power interest is what leads to the Mexican War
    - ==Wilmot Proviso== : never passed, states that slavery cannot be allowed in any territory gained from the Mexican War. Whigs wanted to pass this b/c they know it wouldn’t pass, proving that the Mexican American War was a slave power conspiracy
- Territories don't extend Missouri Compromise line
- ==Calhoun's State Sovereignty:==  says that individuals in each of the states have the right to use the territories equally (open to all American citizens) → if a Michigander can move to California and bring their belongings with him (property), then a South Carolinian can do the same, with their property INCLUDING their slaves
- ==Free Soil Party==  (not abolitionist): wage labor, no slave labor but they’re not abolitionist 
{ #32abaf}

- ==Lewis Cass== : MI state governor, uses idea of Popular Sovereignty → people in territories can vote whether they want slavery or want
  - ==Charm of ambiguity== : states that a territory’s population cannot vote until it becomes a formal state
    - South want this b/c they want slavery to be established first
    - North wants the vote at any time the territory has a population large enough to have a territorial assembly
- ==Gold Rush== : young men setting off to CA to get gold, means that law and order needs to be implemented
#### Compromise of 1850
  - Slave trade abolished in Washington D.C
  - Texas boundary set, Texas gets $10 million for territory lost to NM territory
  - NM and UT  territories established by popular sovereignty
  - [[Chapter 12 - Politics and Fate of the Union, 1812-1859#^d099fa \|Fugitive Slave Act]] strengthened (North responds w/ personal liberty laws), gave additional powers to slave owners to recapture slaves and angered northerners b requiring their complicity
    - Citizens can be deputized to join a search party for a runaway slave
    - $10 if a U.S marshal returns a fugitive to the South
    - There’s no requirement for a fugitive’s appearance, so free men from the North were being taken to the South to become slaves, even though they were born free
{ #e765e6}

  - Slave TRADE illegal in D.C
  - CA joins union
- In the South, the disintegration of the Whig Party had left many southerners at loose ends politically. The security of their own communities seemed at stake, and in the 1850s, most formerly Whig slaveholders converted to the Democratic Party
- ### Kansas Nebraska Act
  - Compromised compromises → nation at this point has relied on the Missouri Compromise, however Nebraska and Kansas were slave states
  - ==Stephen Douglas==  - Illinois Senator, wants to create a transcontinental railroad with a terminus in Chicago, has to gain southern support
    - Terminus in Chicago would anger the Southerners significantly, plus the RR would have to lay through Kansas, which isn’t settled
    - ==Kansas Nebraska Act== : Douglas overturns the Missouri Compromise, making the South happy, who then approve the building of the RR
{ #37fcac}

    - Douglas gets rid of the [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^86bca6 \|Missouri Compromise ]]because Kansas & Nebraska territory wasn’t settled & it didn’t have a climate susceptible for slave-produced crops
  - ==Border Ruffians==  (pro-slavery forces) cross over to Kansas to vote → Kansas and Nebraska slave stance is to be settled by popular sovereignty
- Consequences of the Kansas Nebraska Act: **(1)** end of the second party system/beginning of the third **(2)** Whig party falls apart - Northern & Southern Whigs can't work together
{ #d5064e}

- ==Know Nothings== : anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant party whose influence peaked in the mid-1850s 
- The [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^d5064e \|Kansas Nebraska Act]] spawned hatred and violence as land-hungry partisans in the sectional struggle clashed repeatedly in Kansas Territory. Abolitionists and religious groups sent in armed Free-Soil settlers; southerners sent in their reinforcements to establish slavery and prevent “northern hordes” from stealing Kansas
- In May, a proslavery posse sent to arrest the Free-Soil leaders sacked Kansas town of Lawrence, killing several people and destroying a hotel with a cannon.
- These passions brought violence to the U.S. Senate in May 1856, when ==Charles Sumner==  denounced “the Crime against Kansas” → Since he was radical in his anti-slavery views he got beat by a cane by Representative Preston Brooks
#### Republican Party
{ #c03e4a}


  - Antislavery Whigs & Democrats, Free-Soilers, and other reformers throughout the old NW met to form the Republican party, a coalition dedicated to keeping slavery out of the territories 
  - ![[Party systems.canvas]]
#### Dred Scott Case
  - ==Dred Scott==  and his wife, ==Harriet Robinson Scott== , sued for their freedom based on their former owner taking them for several years into Illinois, a free state, and to Fort Snelling in the Missouri Compromise. SC created multiple precedents w/ this case: 
    1. Scott not a citizen of the US or MO
    2. Residence in a free state does not make you free
    3. Congress has no power to bar slavery from any territory
    4. African Americans have “no rights which the white man was bound to respect”
- ==John Brown’s Raid== : an unsuccessful attempt to start a slave revolution on the federal arsenal @ Harper’s Ferry. It resulted in the death of 10 people, including two of Brown's sons, and Brown himself was later hanged for treason 

## Chapter 5: The Civil War & Reconstruction

- SC is first state to secede and many states follow:
  ![[Pasted image 20230115214819.png \| 500]]

- Lincoln sought only to hold onto forts in the states that had left the Union, reasoning that in this way he could assert federal sovereignty while waiting for a restoration.
- ==George B. McClellan:==  Union general very popular with troops who proved better at organization and training at fighting
- ==Anaconda plan== : called for a blockade of southern ports and eventual capture of the Missouri River → “strangle” the Confederacy  
- ==Ulysses S. Grant:==  Union general who, in 1864, became Commanding General of the United States army
- ==Robert E. Lee:==  Confederate general who, in 1862, commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. In 1865 he became the general-in-chief of the Confederate army
- Davis desperately wanted European nations to recognize the Confederacy
#### Battles of the Civil War
  *==Fort Sumter:==  Federal fort in Charleston harbor, South Carolina where the first shots of the Civil War were fired when the Union attempted to resupply troops  
  *==Battle of Bull Run:==  first major land battle of the civil war. Half a million southerners volunteered to fight  
  *==Battle of Shiloh:==  The bloodiest battle in American history to that date, and it happened in southern Tennessee  
  *==Battle of Antietam:==  First major battle on northern soil. McClellan moved slowly, failed to use his larger forces in simultaneous attacks, and allowed Lee’s stricken army to retreat to safety across the Potomac  
  *==Battle of Chancellorsville:==  decisive Confederate victory in the American Civil War, where Robert E. Lee and his army defeated the larger Union forces of Joseph Hooker.  
  *==Battle of Vicksburg:==  Union vic roy that gave the North complete control of the Mississippi  
  * If Vicksburg fell, Union forces would control the river, cutting the Confederacy in 2 and gaining an open path → interior
  *==Battle of Gettysburg:==  Union victory that halted the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania; turning point in the war in the East  
  * Vicksburg & Gettysburg (both intense battles w/ high casualty rates) forced General Kirby Smith to operate on his own
  - War finally ended in spring of 1865 @ the ==Surrender @ Appomattox==
- ==Peace Democrats:==  fought to regain power by blaming Lincoln for the war’s death toll, the expansion of federal powers, inflation and the high tariff, and the emancipation of black people 
  - Its leaders called for an end to the war and reunion on the basis of “the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was

#### War transforms the South
  - One of the first traditions to fall was the southern preference for local and limited government. States’ rights had been a formative ideology for the Confederacy, but state governments were weak operations → Creation of a large govt. bureaucracy (==government girls== )

  - Faced with a critical shortage of troops, in April 1862 the Confederate government enacted the first national conscription (draft) law in American history. Thus, the war forced unprecedented change on states that had seceded out of fear of change
    - ==Confederate Draft==  - As their fortunes declined, people of once-modest means looked around and found abundant evidence that all classes were not sacrificing equally. The Confederate government enacted policies that decidedly favored the upper class.
    - Until the last year of war, for example, prosperous southerners could avoid military service by hiring substitutes.
  - Davis adopted a firm leadership role toward the Confederate Congress, which raised taxes and later passed a tax-in-kind - paid in farm products.
  - Davis further exhorted state governments to require farmers to switch from cash crops to food crops. But the army remained short of food and labor 
  - The wives and mothers of soldiers now headed households and performed men’s work, including raising crops and tending animals.  

  - All arms, supplies & troops under national command
  - Suspended writ of habeas corpus (prevents individuals from being held w/o a trial
  - Impose martial law
  - Impressed slaves to work on fortifications
  - Seize control of railroads
  - Inequities and the “==20 Negro Law== ”: if someone eligible for the draft has 20+ slaves, they're exempt from the Draft

#### Emancipation Proclamation
  - After the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln declares “all persons held as slaves in areas in rebellion shall be then, thenceforward and forever free
    - But … not the border states and not any country or city under Union control
  - Makes the Northern Army an army of liberation → whatever areas the Union controls, all slaves are forever free & abolishes slavery
  - Lincoln based this on his powers of Commander in Chief, so it could expire after his term → must amend the constitution!!
  - When Lincoln wins re-election in 1864 (largely b/c he lets soldiers vote), he forces Congress to create an amendment abolishing slavery → 13th Amendment
- Both Lincoln & the slaves themselves are accredited with freeing the slaves; **(1)** Lincoln: Emancipation proclamation & 13th Amendment, **(2)** slaves: if the slaves didn't free themselves throughout the south, the confiscation acts wouldn't've been necessary

- Lincoln is shot in April of 1865 & his VP, Andrew Johnson, takes power
- ==Sherman’s Special Field Order Number 15== : 400,000 acres in Sea Islands region… Johnson overturns it
