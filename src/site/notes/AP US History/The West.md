### U.S Indian policy in the west
 
- Native populations in the west - lifestyle vary by ecology of the region 
	- Crop growing (prairie regions)
	- Livestock raising 
	- Hunting/fishing/gathering[[AP US History/Civil War & Reconstruction\|Civil War & Reconstruction]]
	- Trading & raiding
- Big factors: slaughter of the buffalo, decline of salmon, "too much testosterone" and government policies & treaties 
- What changes in the west?
	- White men with lots of testosterone who come west in search of the gold rush or the [[AP US History/The West#^0b9b31 \|Homestead Act]]
	- Loss of wildlife (salmon, buffalo)
### U.S government policy
- ==Reservation policy:== US govt. forces multiple (possibly warring) tribes on the same reservations, then didn't respect the treaties . Is active until the 1880's until the govt. takes an assimilation stance

- Portion of former lands, with promised protection from white encroachment, and agreements to provide food, clothing and other necessities 
- Movement into market economy increased many tribes' dependence on federal government subsidies 
> [!info] Problems
> - Ward status (like children) - defined the Natives as helpless children under the protection of the U.S government
> 	- Denied U.S citizenship
> 	- No 14th/15th amendment protection
> 	- White settlers continued to encroach on Native lands no matter what the treaty agreement or reservation boundaries said; ignored Native history by putting warring tribes on the same land

### Resistance & Indian Wars
- Navajo, "Long Walk" (1863-64, much like the [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^5ae16c\|trail of tears]])
- ==Sand Creek Massacre== of Cheyenne band by Major John Chivington (1864): a group of soldiers gets drunk then kill an entire tribe while they were PEACEFULLY transitioning to a new reservation (?) UNDER TREATY → goes to congress 
- Pinnacle of resistance: ==Little Big Horn== → Lakota Cheyenne destroyed the U.S military and there were no white settlers left alive. Most successful Indian rebellion → marks the end of native resistance
- ==The Ghost Dance== was a reaction to U.S colonialism and it entailed dancing for hours in order to communicate with elders & negotiate for a future that respected their belief. 
- Ghost Dance begins a conflict b/c some natives tell whites that their dance outfits are bulletproof, initiating ==Wounded Knee==
- Reform
- ==Women's National Indian Association==: white women bring literacy, western civilization to native societies in attempts to bring reform. They find problem w/ Native society's work balance → women's role is more substantial in native society than separate sphere society  
{ #fe3a2e}

- ==Indian Rights Association:== groups that believe Natives have a right to citizenship and landholding 
- Emphasis on European sexual division of labor (native women lose traditional role) 
### Dawes Severalty Act
- Supported by the [[AP US History/The West#^fe3a2e\|Women's National Indian Association]] 
- Ends reservation policy
- Logical extension of reform, seeks to assimilate Native Americans by emphasizing private land ownership and western family structures
- Family head of household receives 160 acres, each child under 18 gets 40 acres 
	- Land held in trust for 45 years. Citizenship to Native Americans who take the allotment
- Unallocated lands could be sold to whites (SCAMMERS!)
- Case study of the Ojibwas: 138 million acres (1887) → 52 million (1930)
- ==Carlisle school:== most infamous native assimilation school 
### How the West was won (government/big business cooperation)
- Mining - Nevada, Montana, Utah, Colorado
- Miners prospected, but major corporations mined deposits using modern technologies
	- Example: Anaconda Copper Company (gold, copper, lead, zinc, tin, quartz)
- Lumber corporations - ==Timer and Stone Act:== land deemed unfit for cultivation was sold to settlers for logging + valuable metals
- Oil corporations
- Cattle ranching
- ==Central & Union Pacific:== massive land subsidies and other incentives (180 million acres) from federal, state, local govt. 
### Water 
- ==Riparian Rights==: only those who owned land along a river bank could appropriate from the water's flow. The stream itself belonged to God, those who live near water can take from it but not diminish its flow; largely practiced in the East. "Common law" like [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^c325c6\|Coverture]]
- ==Prior Appropriation:== awarded a river's water to the first person who claimed it - water existed to serve human needs and advance profits (LMFAO WHAT). 
- ==California Solution:== mixed legal system that allowed farmers to organize into districts to construct and operate irrigation projects that could purchase water rights, seize private property, and build irrigation canals → pay for it all via taxation or issuing bonds 
- ==Newlands Reclamation Act:== authorized the Secretary of the Interior to designate irrigation sites and to establish a reclamation fund from the sale of public lands to finance the projects (federal)
### New states
- ==Omnibus Bill of 1889:== ND, SD, WA, MT
- 1890 - WY & ID (allowed women to vote!)
- 1896 - Utah (should've been earlier)

### Farming the plains
- ==28 inch rainfall line== - West of this line agriculture is very difficult w/o modern irrigation
![Pasted image 20230130124213.png|500](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230130124213.png)
- 1870s - 1880s: more acres put under cultivation in Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas than the entire nation in 250 years
- Insufficient lumber - sod houses, buffalo dung, and barbed wire 
- Unpredictable weather - ==The Children's Blizzard== (1888)
- Social isolation b/c of the war Americans farm
- John Glidden created barbed wire → changed future of fences & property lines
- Mail order companies - Sears & rural free delivery
- Over-farming of the plains occurs thanks to [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^17ae97\|Homestead Act]] & other related acts
- Sears saved a lot of families during first year of homesteading. Amazon:Covid = Sears:Fronteir 
- ==Morril Land Grant Acts (1862/1890):== set aside federal lands to create colleges to “benefit the agricultural and mechanical arts.” 
- ==Hatch Act:== provided for necessary basic and applied agricultural research to be conducted by the state colleges of agriculture in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
- ==Dry Farming:== crop production without irrigation during a dry season 
- ==Russian wheat:== wheat that grows easily on the plains, brought from Russia
- Luther Burbank & George Washington Carver were horticulturists who researched crops that grow easily on the plain - Carver created the peanut 
- Vaqueros - Open-range ranching 
- ==Fence Cutter wars:== series of disputes between cowboys w/ larger land holdings   
- 21 year era of the cowboy was put to an end by the use of barbed wire 
### "New" South?
- Henry Grady, editor, *Atlanta Constitution*
- Mixed industry and Commercial Agriculture - infrastructure to tie together the South & North. Not a total focus on industrialism in the South though ⇒ **doesn't work**
- Industry in the South: textile mills, cigarette (Duke buys patent for a cigarette rolling machine), lumber, iron/steel, Coca-Cola, coal mining - railroads 
- Agriculture - share cropping, tenant farming, crop lien
	- $\frac{1}{3}$ of farmers were sharecroppers @ 1880
	- $\frac{2}{3}$ of farmers were sharecroppers @ 1920
- Closing the Southern range
- Continued racism limited economic advancement

- Thesis: racism complicated the west, foreshadowing the challenges the U.S will face with diversity in the 2nd century
- Social unrest is occurring @ the same time in China 
	- Push: railroad
	- Pull: home 
- *==People v. Hall:==*  involved an attempted murder charge against the defendant, Jonathan Hall. Hall was accused of shooting at two people, striking one in the arm. He was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Whether Chinese can testify against whites, blanks, Indians ⇒ SC rules that "if Indians are banned, then Asians should be as well". Prohibits the testimony on the basis that the groups should have been put together (?)
- =="The Chinese Must Go" Movement:== w/ new wave of immigrants, Irish are now "apart" of U.S culture
	- Led in San Francisco by Irish immigrant
- ==Chinese Exclusionary Laws== (1882): federal law stopping almost all immigration from China → US
{ #600dcd}

	- Expires in 20 years, continued until 1940
- ==Anti-Miscegenation Laws:== laws banning interracial sexual relations; passed primarily to prevent Chinese men from marrying white women
### Exodusters: African Americans in the West
- ==Exodusters:== African Americans who move to the west (post-Civil War) & even form their own all-black towns
	- Very few African Americans leave the South after the civil war ⇒ attempt to stay in place & rebuild family after  they're freed
- [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^32abaf\|Free soil]]
- ==Exclusion laws:== laws banning blacks from certain towns in the West 
	- ==Sundown towns:== all-white municipalities that practice racial segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation or violence ⇒ **if any blacks are caught out & about after sundown, they're lynched** (?)
- 14th & 15th Amendments in CA and OR: both states finally ratify the 14th/15th Amendments
### Mormons in the West
- [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^e1bd7e\|Second Great Awakening]], Joseph Smith, & the *Book of Mormon*
