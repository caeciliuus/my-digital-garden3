### Border states
- Important because they were occupied by Union troops but still had slavery after the Emancipation Proclamation
1. Missouri
2. Kentucky
3. West Virginia 
4. Delaware
5. Maryland
6. Civil War begins when N.C fires ships (Union) resupplying Fort Sumter 
### Anaconda Plan
- Union blockades the Atlantic Ocean to prevent üá¨üáß from resupplying
- Take control of the Mississippi River, cutting the South in half from their food source
- Capture VA (doesn‚Äôt happen until the end of the war)
### The War of Southern Secession

- School teachers (for the first time) 
### Northern Economy
- The North will win the war in large part because it is more fully industrialized than the South, but the Civil War will also push the North into a full industrial revolution
- Treasury, new national banking system w/ national bank notes, greenbacks, income tax
- Furthered agricultural revolution as machines replace missing workers
- ==Quartermaster Dept.==: Montgomery Meigs. Ex: Jay Cooke & govt. bonds
	- Meigs invested a lot of money into the Union army, equipping soldiers lavishly
- Transcontinental RR and govt. subsidies
	- U.S invested money into the railroad companies
- ==Morrill Land Grant Act==: set aside federal lands for states to create colleges to ‚Äúbenefit the agricultural and mechanical art‚Äù
- ==Homestead Act==: gave 160 acres of land to whoever would farm the land for 5 years and improve it

### The War to end slavery?
- While Lincoln was running for president, he said he‚Äôll do whatever it take to unite the union ‚Üí ban slavery in the South
- As time went on, Lincoln became significantly more opposed to slavery
	- Against slavery but ‚Äúblacks & whites‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt live together ‚Üí colonization (Liberia) fully against slavery & integration
- ==First Confiscation Act==: confiscated all property used for insurrectionary purposes; mandated that if the South used slaves in their war effort,
- ==Second Confiscation Act==: confiscated property of **anyone who supported** the war; freed all slaves held by the South
- [[AP US History/S1/S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^ca33f8\|Gradual emancipation]] w/ compensation for slave owners & colonization
### Emancipation Proclamation 
- After the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln declares ‚Äúall persons held as slaves in areas in rebellion shall be then, thenceforward and forever free
	- But ‚Ä¶ not the border states and not any country or city under Union control 
- Makes the Northern Army an army of liberation ‚Üí whatever areas the Union controls, all slaves are forever free & abolishes slavery
- Lincoln based this on his powers of Commander in Chief
- When Lincoln wins re-election in 1864 (largely b/c he lets soldiers vote), he forces Congress to create an amendment abolishing slavery ‚Üí 13th Amendment
### Who Freed the Slaves?
- Both Lincoln and Slaves are accredited with freeing the slaves
	- Lincoln: Emancipation Proclamation & 13th Amendment
	- Enslaved people: if slaves didn‚Äôt free themselves throughout the South, the confiscation acts wouldn‚Äôt have been necessary
### Reconstruction
- Important questions
    1. Who should rule in the South (the traditional ruling elite who committed treason by seceding?)
    2. Who should rule in the federal government (how to rebalance power after the massive expansion of the executive branch under Lincoln)
        - After Lincoln expanded the executive Branch, the government wanted to return power to congress
    3. What rights should freedmen have?
        - Radical republicans say its all of them
    4. What will Reconstruction be at its essence? A second revolution?
- Jackson is elected but quickly impeached, returning power back to congress. Johnson takes over b/c congress is adjourned for months

| (1) Lincoln‚Äôs 10% plan: 10% of a state‚Äôs population must pledge loyalty to the federal government. Louisiana, Tennessee & Arkansas join the Union w/ the 10% rule. Federal government & constitution, end slavery. | (2) Wade-Davis Bill: (1) majority of white male citizens must participate in creating a new government; (2) 50% of the population must sign an ironclad oath stating they never supported the confederacy; (3) high Confederate officials are stripped of citizenship |
| (3) Lincoln pocket vetoes the Wade-Davis Bill; he doesn‚Äôt do anything about it and lets it expire                                                                                                                  | (4) Wade-Davis Manifesto: manifesto written by Radical Republicans urging voters to not vote for their candidate, Lincoln,                                                                                                                                            |

### 13th Amendment & Freedman‚Äôs Bureau
- Problems w/ Emancipation Proclamation. 1864 Republican platform
- 13th Amendment
	- Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
	- Section 2. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation ‚Üí complete change in government. Before: tyranny comes from non-local government. Now: the federal government looks out for tyranny, creates a safety net
- Freedman‚Äôs Bureau: supplied food and medical services, built several thousand schools and some colleges, negotiated several hundred thousand employment contracts, tried to manage confiscated land
- Congress tells Southern states that if they want help from the government, they must ratify the 13th amendment (2/3 of congress votes the amendment out and 2/3 of the states must ratify
- Emancipation Proclamation was created as executive order, so it could end at end of war, therefore the 13th amendment is necessary
### 40 Acres and a Mule
- Sherman‚Äôs Special Field Order Number 15: 400,000 acres in Sea Islands region‚Ä¶ Johnson overturns it
- Instead, sharecropping begins: tenants live on land that the landlord rents them, incl land, tools & feed, exchange for half of their crops

Greatest danger to liberty are the states  |
| (7) ‚ÄúSwing Around the Circle‚Äù - Johnson tried to get democrats in Congress to work on reconstruction but the Radical Republicans stayed in congress | (8) (Military) Reconstruction Act of 1867: creates five military generals with small(ish) troops garrisoning to enforce fair election. |
| (9)Continued Intransigence - Johnson continues to obstruct the work of congress  | (10) 2nd, 3rd, 4th reconstruction Acts; Tenure of Office: prohibited the president from removing a member of the cabinet without seeking approval from congress  |
