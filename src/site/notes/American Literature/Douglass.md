###### Analyze Fredrick Douglas's work **rhetorically**
- "Logos" #logos  → logic, the text itself
- Underscores the emotion of the slave community
- Points about arbitrary rules 
- "Pathos" #pathos  → emotion, getting a reaction
- "Ethos" #ethos credibility/sources 
- Douglas has high credibility, b/c he's a first source 
- Trying to reveal the reality of slavery no matter where you are 
---
- (Assertion ↔ denial) → audience: Douglas can take a different stance (assertion/denial) in order to play on the audience's emotion. Applies to #logos logos and #pathos pathos 
- Examples of each from #douglass Douglass' "Narrative"

> [!Examples of the "rhetoric triangle" from Douglass' "Narrative"]
> - **Pathos**: "Our fate for life was now to be decided. We had no more voice in that decision than the brutes among whom we were ranked. A single word from the white men was enough—against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties—to sunder forever the dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings"; <font color="green"> no one knows if they'll see each other again, lack of community & sense of famility </font>
> - **Ethos:** "We seldom called him “master;” we generally called him “Captain Auld,” and were hardly disposed to title him at all. I doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward, and of consequence fretful"; <font color="green"> knowledge of the bible → slave owners use the bible to justify slavery, he uses the bible to "unjustify" their cruelty </font>
> - **Logos**: "If it had any effect on his character, it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways; for I believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before. Prior to his conversion, he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity; but after his conversion, he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty" <font color="green"> slave master is a Christian man yet he's immoral and a shitty person → illogical, rhetoric </font>

- Referencing specific names is an example of ethos #ethos → provides real names of people that others might actually know, proving his credibility 
---
- Shows the bible doesn't support slavery unless you twist it; highlighting the hypocrisy of the aversion of it #logos 
- Graphic descriptions emphasize the brutality of slavery #ethos

I have often, in the deep stillness of a summer’s  Sabbath,  stood  all  alone  upon  the  lofty  banks  of  that noble  bay,  and  traced,  with  saddened  heart  and  tearful  eye,  the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. The sight  of  these  always  affected  me  powerfully.== My  thoughts would  compel  ut*

Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to  some  one.  It  may  be  that  my  misery  in  slavery  will  only increase  my  happiness  when  I  get  free.  There  is  a  better  day coming.”== Thus  I  used  to  think,  and*

I  made him  no  answer,  but  stood  with  my  clothes  on.  He  repeated  his order.  I  still  made  him  no  answer,  nor  did  I  move  to  strip myself. Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore  off  my  clothes,  and  lashed  me  till  he  had  worn  out  his switches,  cutting  me  so  savagely  as  to  leave  the  marks  visible for  a  long  time  after.
