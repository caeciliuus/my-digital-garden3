### Anne Bradstreet (Puritan)
- ABABCCC rhyme scheme
##### Contemplations
- Reference to Greek mythology represents her high level of education
- Expresses Bradstreet’s struggle between love for earth & longing for eternal life
- Begins with Bradstreet admiring nature, leading her to think about God and how much greater he must be than his creations, which are already beautiful → related to common experience of admiring nature to the beauty of God
- Inspired by an Oak tree; by selecting a single oak tree from all the beauty around her, she marvels about the longevity of the oak and its spiritual parallel → eternity
- Contemplates the sun, acknowledges its glory, causing it to be considered a God by some societies
##### Prologue
Writes that she doesn’t discuss the same topics as male poets (war) , rather focuses on more obscure, intimate and personal things
Compares herself to Bartas, whose work was popular w/ Puritans. Doesn’t aspire to be an equal to him, but rather aspires to be simple and true to her skill
Invokes the muse and compares herself to a school boy. Envy for the more obvious parts of male anatomy
Alludes to a Greek orator (once again representing her high education & intelligence), who overcame a lisp to achieve fame. Relates it to herself as she’s a woman, however believes she has a weak mind
Highlights misogyny, angry at those who tell her to stick to sewing over writing. Believes she wouldn’t even get credit for her work because she’s a woman - people would say she stole it
Discusses the patriarch in ancient Greece, but she believes she has the right to have a voice and supports domesticity as a source of verse → women are capable of writing as well
Downplays her poetry, humbling herself. Relates her work to unimpressive, yet simple, house plants.
Masculine pretensions to intellectual superiority are unnecessary
##### In Memory of my Dear Grandchild

##### Upon the Burning of our House
Written in response to the real-life destruction of Bradstreet’s house, in which she grieves the loss of her home and all her material possessions
Argues that this tragedy was God’s way of teaching her a spiritual lesson about the value of piety and faith.
Takes comfort in the belief that no amount of earthly wealth comes close to spiritual wealth, awaiting us in the afterlife

### Irving (early American) - Rip Van Winkle
**Summary:** Rip Van Winkle is a classic story by Washington Irving about a man who falls asleep in the Catskill Mountains and wakes up 20 years later. After an encounter with mysterious men playing ninepins, Rip falls asleep and wakes to find that the American Revolution has taken place in his absence. He returns to his village, where he discovers that his wife has died and his friends no longer recognize him. As the village gossips about Rip's strange disappearance, he realizes that he can never go back to his old life and must forge a new one in the changing world
Though there was dramatic change, Rip’s life and the life of the villagers goes on much the same way as it did before. He becomes a figure who stands for sameness and the past, linking the peaceful time before the revolution to the bustling time after.
Rip’s son is his “ditto”, or splitting image: the next generation is much the same as the last. This suggests a comforting indefinite continuity, thus the hero’s ultimate accomplishment is his ability to resist the drive to progress and change
The comical death of Rip’s wife means that Rip is free from more than one tyrant.
**Themes**
Tyranny vs. freedom
Active vs. passive resistance
Truth, history, storytelling
Labor vs. productivity
Change vs statis
