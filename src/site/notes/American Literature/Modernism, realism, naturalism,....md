| Focuses on the ordinary            | Rejects the ordinary, focusing on the fringes of society & experience – often include extreme or shocking events/material |
| Focuses on the invidual            | Not interested in the individual, but in larger human patterns & movements                                                |

### Effects of WWI
- Disillusionment with America → certain writers believe that America should get involved in WWI b/c its the biggest war in history. Called expatriates
	- Distance themselves from the materialism and banality of American culture
- The replacement of a belief in absolute knowable truth with a sense of relative, provisional truths (idea of reality as a constructed fiction
- Less emphasis on art's reflection of external reality and a **greater emphasis on art's reflection of the perceiving mind** 
### Modernism
- **Common themes**
	- Individual perceptions and ordinary life
	- Literal, psychological, cultural alienation
	- Disillusionment with progress, history, God
	- Powerlessness (partial or complete)
	- World as real and cultural wasteland 
- **Characters, plot**
- Skepticism about linear plots w/ sudden climactic turning points and clear resolutions
	- Instead: discontinuous fragments, achronological order
- **Style**
	- Characterized by experimentation, innovation, tracing non-linear thought-processes, stream of consciousness
	- POV: rejection of the single, authoratative narrator
