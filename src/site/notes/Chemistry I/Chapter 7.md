### Solutions
##### Aqueous solutions
- Water is a ==SOLVENT==
	- A solvent is a substance (often a liquid but also a gas) that dissolves 1+ pure substances
- The solid, liquid, or gas that dissolves in a solution is called the ==SOLUTE==
- The resulting combination of solute dissolved into solvent is called the ==SOLUTION== (see examples)
	- Lemonade
	- Coke
	- Hot chocolate
- When water is the solvent, it's called an ==aqueous solution==
##### Water
- Since water is such a good solvent, it is rarely ever 100% pure
- When water flows through pipes it can pick up toxins
- When water rains it can actually dissolve some of the gases thus 'cleaning' the air, leaving us w/ acid rain 
##### Concentration
- Concentration is the ratio of the amount of solute to the amount of solute
>[!info] We use 4 ways to express concentration
>- **Percent** (%)
>- Parts per million (ppm)
>- Parts per billion (ppb)
>- **Molarity** (Mol)
- ==Percent composition== [[Chemistry I/S1 Wiki (CHEM)#^50d723\|(refrence):]] $\text{Percent}=\frac{part}{whole}\times 100\%$
	- The units HAVE TO MATCH!!!! Doesn't matter what units they are 
>[!example] % Composition examples
>1. **"a solution is preprared by dissolving 1.0g of sodium chloride in 48 of water, what is the mass composition?"** →  $\frac{1}{49}\times 100 = 2\%$
>2. **"Calculate the mass, in pounds, of solute present in 375lb of 1.51%** $\bf{NH_4Cl}$" → $\frac{x}{375}\times100=1.51\%$
- ==Molarity== is represented by the number of moles of solute present in an amount of liters of solution → $M=\frac{Moles}{Liters}$
	- You need moles and you need liters!!!!
>[!example] Molarity examples
>1. "4 moles of NaCl in 8 moles of water" → $\bf{\frac{1}{2}}$
>2. ".5 moles of sodium chloride is dissolved to make 0.05L of solution" → $\frac{0.5mol}{0.05L}=\bf{10M}$
>3. "734g of LiCl are dissolved to make 2500mL of solution" → $\frac{734gNaCl}{2500mL}\frac{17.3137molNaCl}{2.5L}=\bf{6.9M}$

##### Ionic equations
- An ionic equation takes a molecular equation and breaks apart the compounds that are aqueous into their separate **IONS**
	- Example: $KCL_{(aq)} +AgNO_{3(aq)}\to AgCl_{(s)}+KNO_{3(aq)}$ → $\textcolor {green}{K^+}+CL^-+Ag^++\textcolor {green}{NO^-_{3}} \to AgCl +\textcolor {green}{K^+}+\textcolor {green}{NO^-_{3}}$
- A full ionic equation has some ions that **don't do anything**
	- They are broken down into ions before & after the reaction happens. They don't turn into a solid or liquid, they just tag along for the ride (see green text)
- Start w/ full equation, break into different ions, then remove "spectator ions"
	- Ions are spectator ions when they become aqueous again on the product side
- $HBR_{{(aq)}}+Ba(OH)_{2(aq)}\to BaBr_{2}+H_{2}O$
	1. Balance it: $2HBR_{{(aq)}}+Ba(OH)_{2(aq)}\to BaBr_{2}+2H_{2}O$
	2. Break it down: $2H +2Br^-+Ba^{2+}+2OH^-\to BA^{+2}+2Br^-+2H_{2}O$
	3. Remove spectator ions: $2H+2OH^-\to{2}H_{2}O$ ⇒ **final product**
### Dilution
==Dilution:== A solution of high concentration (molarity) has more solvent added to it to make a solution of lower concentration (molarity)

- Equation used for dilution problem: $M_{1}V_{1}=M_{2}V_{2}$
	- M = molarity
	- V = volume
	- 1 = pre-dilution
	- 2 = post-dilution
>[!example] Sample dilution problem
> *A 25mL sample of 11.6M HCL is diluted with enough water to make the total solution volume 120.0 mL. Find the molarity of the diluted solution*
>$\bf(11.6M)(25mL)=x(120mL)$ → $\bf2.4M$
### Liquid stoichiometry 
When doing stoich problems, we have a new relationship that can be applied to the stoich process: [[Solutions#^f5e7bf]\|molarity (M)]]= $\frac{moles\space{solute}}{1L \space {solution}}$ 
>[!example] Example
>*Mixing 25mL of .1M $AgNO_{3}$ with excess $CaCl$ produces $Ag_2Cl$ and $Ca{(NO_3)}_2$. Determine the mass of the precipitate formed from this reaction*
>1. Write balanced equation: $2AgNO_{3\space{(aq)}}+CaCl_{2\space{(aq)}}\longrightarrow 2AgCl_{(s)}+Ca{(NO_3)}_{2\space {(aq)}}$ 
>2. Stoichiometry time!
>	a. vol. and conc. → mol: $(.1M)(.025L)=0.0025mol\space AgNO_3$
>	b. mol → mol: $0.0025mol\space AgNO_3(\frac{2mol\space AgCl}{2mol\space AgNO_3})=0.0025mol\space AgCl$
>	c. mol → g: $0.0025mol\space AgCl(\frac{143.5g}{1mol\space AgCl})=\bf.35g AgCl$
### Colligative properties
- There are 2 main colligative properties that we will look at: 
	- The change in boiling or freezing water
	- Osmotic pressure
- A colligative property is a physical property of a solution which is dependent only on the number of solute particles present; the chemical formula is **not** important 
- ==Freezing point depression:== A solution will solidify (freeze) @ a lower temperature than the pure solvent
- ==Boiling point elevation:== a solution will boil at a higher temperature than the pure solvent 
	- Ex: antifreeze
- Remember for both properties, it depends on the # of solute particles present 
- Equation representing change in temp: $\bf\Delta T=kim$
	- $\Delta T$ is the temperature change from the pure solvent's boiling/freezing point to the new boiling/freezing point of the solution
	- K is the boiling point or freezing point constant of the solvent 
	- i is the van't Hoff factor, which is the number of particles a substance becomes when it dissolves 
		- i = 1 for molecular compounds
		- i = # of ionic compounds
		- Ex: $CaCl$ i = 2, $CaCl_2$ i = 3
	- m is molal = $\frac{moles \space solute}{kg \space solvent}$
		- For water solvents = molarity
>[!example] Example
>*What is the boiling point elevation when 44.2g $CaCl_2$ is dissolved in 200g of water?*
>- Given: K for $H_2O$ is .52 C/m
>- $i = 3$
>- $molal=\frac{moles}{kg} \rightarrow 44.2gCaCl_2(\frac{1mol}{111g})=\frac{.39}{.2}=1.95$
>- $\Delta T=(.52)(3)(2) \rightarrow \Delta T=3.04\degree C$
