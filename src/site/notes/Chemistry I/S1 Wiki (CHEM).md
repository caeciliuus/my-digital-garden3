## Nomenclature
### Classification of matter
- Matter: stuff that has mass and takes up space. Classified into pure substance or mixture
    - Pure substance: always the same chemically, only break down chemically. Either an element or a compound (2+ elements w/ constant composition)
    - Mixture: random mix of substances that can be broken down physically
        - Homogenous: uniform throughout (homo = same)
        - Heterogenous: not evenly mixed (hetero = different)
- Physical properties: texture, mass, color, state
    - Physical changes: doesn’t alter substance composition
- Chemical properties: burn, digest
    - Chemical changes: move around the atom, get a new substance
### Notations in formulas
- A subscript indicates number of atoms for the chemical immediately in front of subscript
    - Ex: $CO_2$
- A coefficient indicates how many of that whole compound
    - Ex: $2CO_2$ → 2 carbon, 4 oxygen
- Subscripts outside of a set of parentheses apply to each atom inside
    - $CU(NO_3)_2$ → 1 copper, 2 nitrogen, 6 oxygen

### Binary molecular compound formulas
- Binary molecular compound: 2 non-metal elements covalently bonded together
1. Elements in group 18 come first
2. If there’s no element in group 18, the element furthest to the left comes first
3. If 2 elements bonding are in the same group, the one closer to the bottom is written first
4. First element has a prefix added to it only if there’s more than one of that atom
5. Second element always gets a prefix for number of atoms, even if there’s only one. Name is also changed to end in -ite
![Pasted image 20230118132954.png](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118132954.png)
### Ionic compounds
- Ionic compounds form because of the attraction between opposite charges
- Positive ions are called cations
    - Loss of electrons
    - Overall positive charge
    - Metals tend to lose electrons
- Negative ions are called anions
    - Gain electrons
    - Overall negative charge
    - Non-metals
- When an ion is by itself, the charge is shown as a superscript. When the charge is a - or + 1, the charge is omitted
    - Sodium: $Na^+$
    - Magnesium: $Mg^{2+}$
    - $Cl^-$
    - $O^{2-}$
- A cation name is simply the name + the word “ion”
- An anion from a single element will have the suffix change to -ide/
    - Nitride ion: $N^{3-}$
- To form an ionic compound, cations & ions combine in a way that gives a neutral charge. When this happens, the charge on the individual ions are no longer shown
    - Trisodium nitride: $NA^{1+} + N^{3-} \rightarrow {Na_3}N$
- Rules for determining charges
    - 1st column has +1 charge, 2nd has +2, 13th column has +3 charge, 14th has +4 charge, 15th has -3 charge, 16th has -2, 17th has -1
### Naming ionic compounds
- When writing names of ionic compounds, cation comes first, then the anion. **No prefixes!!**
- Since anions for simple binary compounds have -ide endings, the second name in the formula should also end in -ide
    - Chloride + sodium: $Na^{+1} + Cl^{-1} \rightarrow Sodium \space Chloride$
    - Zinc + iodide: $Zn^{+2} + I^{-1} \rightarrow ZnI_2 \rightarrow Zinc \space Iodide$
    - Oxide + aluminum: $Al^{+3} + O^{-2} \rightarrow Al_2O_3 \rightarrow Aluminum \space oxide$
- Transition metals can have multiple different charges
    - Use roman numerals to specify the charge on each metal ion
    - Iron (II) + chloride: $Fe^{+2} + Cl^{-1} \rightarrow Fe_3 Cl_2 \rightarrow Iron \space (II) \space chloride$
### Bonding w/ polyatomic ions
- Polyatomic ion is a group of atoms that are bonded together and the entire group has a charge (+ or -). Think of them as 1 ion
- Polyatomic groups never have their name changed when naming a compound. No prefixes either
    - Silver nitrate: $Ag^{+1} + NO_3^{-1} \rightarrow AgNO_3$
- Use parentheses only if there are more than one of that group present to balance overall charge
    - Calcium nitrate: $Ca^{+2} + NO_3^{-1} \rightarrow Ca(NO_3)_2$
### Naming acids
- Binary acids: hydrogen, which is always first, bonded with one other element/anion, which is an anion
    - Number of hydrogen atoms present will depend on the charge of the anion
    - Since hydrogen is in group 1, it will have a +1 charge
    - Overall molecule will have a neutral charge
    - $H^{+1} + S^{-2} = H_2S$ → hydrosulfuric acid
    - Naming binary acids: hydro + root of anion + ic acid
        - $HCL =$  hydrochloric acid
- Polyatomic acids (oxyacids): hydrogen, which is still first, with a polyatomic anion which include oxygen as part of the polyatomic
    - Ex: $HNO_3$  → nitric acid
    - Oxyacid polyatomic names DO NOT use the hydro prefix
- Naming oxyacids
    - If the name of the polyatomic ends in -ate, then the -ate wil be replaced with “-ic acid”
        - $HNO_3 \rightarrow$  nit**ric** acid
    - If the name ends in -ite, the -ite is replaced with -ous acid
        - $HNO_2 \rightarrow$ nit**rous** acid
## Numbers
### Accuracy & precision
- Precision refers to how close together a series of measurements are to eachother
- Accuracy refers to how close a measured value is to an accepted value  (% error)

![Pasted image 20230118133759.png|400](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118133759.png)

- For any measurement, the final digit is considered to be the estimated digit
### Significant figures
- Significant figures refer to the number of important single digits in a value
- When you do a computation with a bunch of different values, you dont want to over represent the amount of precision you had
- Rules to determine if a value is significant
    1. Non-zeros: all non-zero integers count as significant 
    2. Leading zeros: found to the left of the first non-zero → not count as significant
    3. Captured zeros: found between non-zero number → count as significant 
    4. Trailing zeros: come after/to the right of the last non-zero → only count as significant **if there is a decimal present**  
	![[Pasted image 20230118133909.png \|500]]
- Examples
    - 124: 3 sig figs
    - 1028: 4 sig figs
    - 0.02904: 4 sig figs
    - 0.020040: 5 sig figs
    - 100,000: 1 sig fig
    - 102,000: 3 sig figs
- Rounding to significant figures
    - The number of significant figures in the result is the same as that in the measurement with the smallest number of significant figures. This is called limiting
        - Ex: $4.56 \times 1.4 = 6.384 \rightarrow 6.4$. Round to 6.4 because 2 sig figs is the smallest number of them
### Metric conversions
- King (kilo) Henry (hecto) Doesn’t (deca) **Usually** (unit) ****drink (deci) chocolate milk (centi)

| Prefix | Symbol | Multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kilo | k | 1,000 → 10^3 |
| Hecta | h | 100 → 10^2 |
| Deca | da | 10 → 10^1 |
| UNIT |  | 1 → 10^0 |
| Deci | d | 0.1 → 10^-1 |
| Centi | c | 0.01 → 10^-2 |
- 14mL = 0.014L
- 44hm = 440,000

### Scientific notation
- Standard scientific notation format: a single digit in front of the decimal
- Moving the decimal point to the left *decreases* the magnitude of every digit in the number. The exponent increases by an equal count
    - $14,000,000 = 1.4 \times 10^7$
- Moving the decimal to the right increases the magnitude of every digit in the number. The exponent decreases by an equal count
    - $0.0000004 = 4.0 \times 10^{-7}$
### Rounding: multiplication & division
- Round answer to whichever original value had least significant figures
    - $124 \times 10 = 1240 \rightarrow 1000$ because the value with the least significant figures (10) only had 2
### Rounding for addition and subtraction
- Round you answer to whichever original value had the least significant decimal place
    - $1420 + 2.4 = 1422.4 \rightarrow 1420$ because the value with least significant decimal place (1420) only went to the tens place, so round the tens place
## Counting
## Formula mass & percent composition
- The periodic table shows the average mass for atoms of each element
- When working with these compounds, we sue these atomic masses to calculate the mass of a single molecule or formula unit → called the formula mass
- Ex: formula mass of $H_2O$ → $(1.01 \times 2) + (16.00) = 18.02$
    - There are 2 hydrogen molecules so you multiply it by two and add it to mass of Oxygen
- We measure the mass of atoms in atomic mass units, abbreviated as “u” or sometimes “amu”
- Formula mass is also known as molecular mass or molecular weight
- Ex: formula mass of $K_2CO_3 \rightarrow 78.20 + 12.00 + 31.98 = 161.08$
- Percent composition: percentage of a substance in a compound
{ #50d723}

    - Calculated by dividing the mass of one element by total mass of a compound, then converting to %
    - $mass \space of \ one \ element \div mass \space of \space compound$
## The MOLE
- Up until now, we’ve expressed molecules using amu. Atomic mass units are too small to be used in the lab
- Counting term: set value that does not depend on the “thing”. Dozen is a counting term for example
- Atoms are counted in groups just like how eggs or donuts are counted in dozens
- 1 mole = $\textcolor{red} {6.022 \times 10^{23}}$
- $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ is known as Amedeo Avogadro
- 1 mole of atoms of any element is number of grams on the periodic table
- When mass if expressed in grams per mole, it is referred to as molar mass
    - Formula mass of $CO_2$ is 44 amu, molar mass is 44 grams
## Mole conversions
### Mole review
- 1 mole = 6.022e$^{23}$ particles/atoms/molecules
- 1 mole = molar mass (in grams).
### Conversions
- Dimensional analysis: multiply given unit by conversion factor
    - $Given = want/given$
    - Ex: how many meters in 24 cm? → $24cm \times \frac {1m} {100cm}\rightarrow .24m$
- How many moles of NaCl are present in a 305g sample?
    - $305gNaCL \times \frac {1 mol NaCl} {58.5gNaCl} \rightarrow \frac {305gNaCl} {58.5} \rightarrow 5.2mol \space NaCl$
- How many grams are in 1.20 moles of NaCl
    - $1.2 mol \space NaCl \times \frac {58.5 gNaCl} {1 mol NaCl} \rightarrow 70.2g \space NaCl$
- Converting between moles & particles: $6.022E^{23} = 1 \space mole$
- Atoms in 4.2 moles of gold?
    - $4.2 Au \space mol \times \frac {6.022E^{23}} {1 Au mol} \rightarrow 2.5e^{24} mol$
## Intro to chemical equations
## Review
- Evidence of a chemical equation
    - Bubbles
    - Significant change in color
    - Fumes
    - Heat/light
- Chemical changes always involve a rearrangement of the ways in which the atoms are grouped
## Chemical equations
{ #c03204}


- We write chemical reactions by writing chemical equations
- The chemicals present before the reaction are on the left, called reactants
- The chemical present after the change on the right are called products
    - $\textcolor{red} {CH_4 + O_2} \rightarrow \textcolor {blue} {CO_2 + H_2O}$
- There must be the same number of each type of atom on the product side as on the reactant side of the arrow. The equation above is ********************unbalanced********************
- Law of Conservation of Mass: in a chemical reaction, atoms are not created nor destroyed
- Diatomic elements cannot be alone. See below for a list of them
- Reminders
    - Subscripts after an atom tell you how many of just that atom
    - Subscripts after a parenthesis tell you how many of everything IN the parenthesis
    - Coefficients before a molecule tell you how many of that entire molecule
- As equations are manipulated/changed to balanced, **you can change how many of the things you have → coefficients**
    - You **cannot change the subscripts** of what it is

![Pasted image 20230118134024.png|400](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118134024.png)

- Balancing chemical equations is primarily done using the guess & check method
    1. Write down the amounts of each atom underneath
    2. Start by adding more to the side that needs it
    3. Rewrite amounts 
    4. Leave any single atoms to the end
- Examples
    - $\textcolor {red} {H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow H_2O}$→$\textcolor {green} {2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O}$
    - $\textcolor {red} {H_3PO_4 + KOH \rightarrow K_3PO_4 + H_2O}$ → $\textcolor {green} {H_3PO_4 + 3KOH \rightarrow K_3PO_4 +3H_2O}$
    - $\textcolor {red} {K + B_2O_3 \rightarrow K_2O + B}$ → $\textcolor {green} {6K + B_2O_3 \rightarrow 3K_2O +2B}$
    - Iron + copper (II) chloride $\rightarrow$ Copper + Iron (III) Chloride = $\textcolor {red} {Fe + CuCl_2 \rightarrow Cu + FeCl_3}$ → $\textcolor {green} {2Fe+ 3CuCl_2 \rightarrow 3Cu + 2FeCl_3}$
## Types of reactions
### Synthesis
- Things coming together
- Two or more separate reactants unite to form a single product

![Pasted image 20230118134139.png](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118134139.png)

- Examples
    - $2Fe + O_2 \rightarrow 2FeO$
    - $CaO + H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2$

### Decomposition
- Things coming apart
- A single reactant is broken down into two or more products

![Pasted image 20230118134210.png](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118134210.png)
- Examples
    - $2H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 2H_2$
    - $2KClO_3 \rightarrow 2KCl + 3O_2$
    - $CaCO_3 \rightarrow CaO + CO_2$

### Single replacement reactions

- A single/free element replaces or is substituted for one of the elements in a compound. The free element is more reactive than the one it replaces
    - In the reaction below, A is more reactive

![Pasted image 20230118134320.png](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118134320.png)
- Examples
    - $Zn + 2HCL \rightarrow ZnCl_2 + H_2$
    - $Cu + 2AgNO_3 \rightarrow 2Ag + Cu(NO_3)_2$

### Double Replacement Reactions

- A swap of partners
- The positive ion (usually listed first) in the first compound swaps with the positive ion in the second compound

![Pasted image 20230118134238.png](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118134238.png)
- Example
    - $BaCl_2 + 2AgNO_3 \rightarrow Ba(NO_3)_2 + 2AgCl$
### Combustion

- Most generally means the reaction of $O_2$ with anything
- The reaction of oxygen with a Hydrocarbon
- A common synonym for combustion is “burn”

![Pasted image 20230118134346.png](/img/user/Et%20cetera/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230118134346.png)
- All hydrocarbon combustion reactions will include $O_2$ and produce $CO_2$ and $H_2O$
- Examples
    - $H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow H_2O$
    - $C + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2$
    - $CH_4 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O$
## Mole ratios
- Use the form of the conversion factor that puts the sought-for unit in the numerator
    - $Given \space unit \times \frac {want} {given}$
    - $14gC(\frac {1 molC} {12gC} = 1.2molC$
    - Conversion factor from mole → gram: 1 mole = molar mass
- “Ratio” = (balanced) coefficients
- $2H_2+O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O$
    - How many moles of oxygen are needed to make 314 moles of water?
    - $314molH_2O (\frac {1molO_2} {2molH_2O}) = 157$
- Conversion factor mol → mol is the coefficient from the balanced equation
## Intro to limiting
- Limiting reactant: reactant that runs out first, thus limiting the amount of product that can be yielded
- You need moles to work with the balanced ratio from chemical equations
### Steps
1. Balance equation
2. Make sure you’re given initial quantities, if not, convert
3. Compare each reactant to the product
- Ex: $2CuCl_2 + 4KI \rightarrow 2CuI + 4KCI + I_2$; when 403.6g of $CuCl_2$ reacts w/ 664g of $KI$, how many g of $I_2$ are formed
    - $403.96gCuCl_2 (\frac {1molCuCl_2} {133gCuCl_2})(\frac {1molI_2} {2molCuCl_2}) = 1.5 molI_2$
    - $664gKI(\frac {1molKI} {166gKI}) (\frac {1molI_2} {4molKI}) = \red {1molI_2}$
    - **Limited by KI** because it yields the least product
- Ex 2: $N_2 + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3$; when 6g $H_2$ reacts w/ 4g $N_2$, how many mol of ammonia are formed
    - $6gH_2(\frac {1molH_2} {2gH_2}) (\frac {2molNH_3} {3molH_2}) = 2molNH_3$
    - $4gN_2(\frac {1molN_2} {28g N_2}) (\frac {2molNH_3} {1molN_2}) = \red {\frac {2} {7} molNH_3}$
    - Limited by $N_2$ because it yields the least product
## Thermodynamics
### Intro to Thermodynamics
- In physical & chemical processes, energy is neither created nor destroyed, but it can be transferred or change forms. This is the law of conservation of energy
- Main types of energy: thermal, radiant, electrical, nuclear, and chemical energy
    - Electrical energy, nuclear energy & chemical energy are different forms of potential energy → energy is stored in an object because of the relative positions or orientations of its components.
    - Kinetic energy (KE) is energy due to the motion of an object
- Energy: **(1)** changes occur in all chemical reactions; **(2)** can be converted from one form to another; **(3)** is either absorbed or released**
- Enthalpy: measure of the heat content of a system. A transfer of heat in/out of a system results in a change of Enthalpy
- $\Delta H$ (Delta H): is used to represent change in Enthalpy
    - $\Delta H$ will be the difference between the enthalpies of the two products and the enthalpies of the reactants
    - $\Delta H = H_{products} -H_{reactants}$
- Reactants and products are the system while the container, the air around it, everything else in the universe is the surroundings
    - So the liquid are the system while the beaker, table, hand and air are surroundings
- Exothermic reaction: energy is released
    - When a system releases heat to its surroundings, the temperature of the surroundings increases. Combustion of a burner is exothermic & it releases heat to pan, heating it up
    - If heat has left the reaction then the Enthalpy of the products will be lower than the reactants ($\Delta H = H_{products} - H_{reactants}$)
    
    ![Untitled](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    - **The $\bold {\Delta H}$ will always be positive**
- Endothermic reaction: energy is absorbed
    - Sometimes a reaction requires heat in order to happen, in this case the system absorbs heat from its surroundings. When you hold ice, the melting is endothermic, thus it takes heat in from your hand, so your hand feels cold
    
    ![Untitled](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2011.png)
    
    - The $**\Delta H$ will always be positive**
- The total enthalpy of a system is equal to the amount of heat transfer
    - Heat transfer is represented by “q”; $\Delta H = q$
- The heat of a system can be determined by multiplying the temperature change of the solution, the mass of the solution, and specific heat capacity of the solution; ${q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T}$
    - m: mass, grams
    - c: specific heat capacity. A substance’s ability to absorb heat; $\frac {J} {g^\circ C}$
    - $\Delta T$: change in temp → $T_f - T_i$ ; C or K
- Heat is a consequence of motion at the molecular level; temperature is a measure of the average speed of that motion
- A state function is defined for a system relating several state variables that depends ****************************************only on the current**************************************** equilibrium state of the system
    - State functions do not depend on the path by which the system arrived at its present state
    - Example: a hiker can climb a mountain going side to side in 10 days while a bird can fly straight to the top of the mountain in 1 day. They cover different distances but ****************************************gain the same altitude**************************************** so altitude is a state function
- Hess’ Law: the enthalpy change accompanying a chemical change is independent of the route by which the chemical change occurs
    - Enthalpy change is simply a particular measure of energy change; enthalpy is a state function
    - Hess’s Law states that if you convert reactants A into products B, the overall **enthalpy change will be exactly the same whether you do it in one steps or many**

## Hess’ Law

- Example:

## Atomic structure

- Atoms, the smallest particles of an element that exhibit the properties of that element, consist of negatively charged electrons around a central nucleus composed of more massive positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons

### History

- J.J Thomson proved that atoms were not the most basic form of matter
    - He demonstrated that cathode rays could be deflected or bent by magnetic or electric fields, indicating that cathode rays consist of charged particles
    
    ![Untitled](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    - Concluded that the particles had a net negative charge → now known as electrons
    - Thomson proposed that the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere that contained both the positive charge and most of the mass of the atoms, much like plum pudding
- The proton was discovered in 1909 by Ernest Rutherford
    - Rutherford showed unambiguously that Thomson’s model of the atom was incorrect. Proved via the [gold foil experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBqHkraf8iE)
    - Evidence of the gold foil experiment suggested that both the mass and positive charge are concentrated in a tiny fraction of the volume of an atoms, which Rutherford called the nucleus
    
    ![Untitled](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2013.png)
    
- Bohr, a scientist from Denmark, stated that the light emitted by hydrogen could be explained if the electrons could only exist in certain allowed orbits → Bohr model

![Untitled](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2014.png)

- Atoms, the smallest particles that exhibit the properties of that element, consist of negatively charged protons around a central nucleus composed of more massive positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons

### Electron configuration

- Electrons are found within regions of space called an orbital, and each orbital has a name
- The first is called the 1s orbital
    - The “1” represents that the orbital is in the energy level closest to the nucleus
- The “s” tells you about the shape
    - S orbitals are spherically symmetric about the nucleus
- The next energy level would be 2
- 3s, 4s, etc. get progressively further from the nucleus. The nearer to the nucleus the electrons get, the lower their energy
- Not all electrons inhabit s orbitals, some inhabit 2p orbitals
    - @ the first energy level. the only orbital available to electrons is the 1s orbital
    - @ the second level, there are orbitals called 2p orbitals, in addition to 2s orbitals
    - P orbitals point in a particular direction (unlike s orbitals)
    - It’s possible to have 3 equivalent p sub-orbitals pointing mutually at right angles to each other
    
    ![Untitled](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2015.png)
    
- @ the third level, there are 5 d orbitals & @ the fourth level, there are 7 f orbitals

![Electron config. on the periodic table](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2016.png)

Electron config. on the periodic table

- Orbitals can be represented as boxes with electrons in them shown as arrow → up-arrow and down-arrow are used to show that the electrons are different in some way
- Ex: $1s^2$
    - 1 = energy level
    - s = type of orbital
    - 2 = number of electrons in orbital
- Aufbau principle: electrons fill low energy orbitals before they fill higher energy ones
- Hund’s rule: the filling of orbitals singly where possible → helps minimize repulsions between electrons, thus making the atom more stable

## Lewis Dot Models

- Core electrons: inner electrons
- Valence electrons: electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom
    - The elements in the same group (column) on the periodic table have the same valence electron configuration
    - Elements with the same valence electron arrangement show very similar chemical behavior
    
    ![These two elements are in the same column so they have the same # of valence electrons ](Semester%201%20Midterm%201055c0bf1a56453e9e214e6d2a95164b/Untitled%2017.png)
    
    These two elements are in the same column so they have the same # of valence electrons 
    
- Ionization energy: energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion
    - Core electrons are bound more tightly than valence electrons
    - Generally increases across a period
    - Decreases down a group

- Atoms in stable compounds usually have a noble gas configuration
    - Metals lose electrons to reach a noble gas config.
    - Nonmetals gain electrons to reach a noble gas config.
- Lewis dot structures show how valence electrons are arranged among atoms in a molecule
    - The chemical symbol for the atom is surrounded by a number of dots corresponding to the number of valence electrons
    - Write the dots clockwise
- Ex: $NO_{3}^{-}$ (LOOK @ ONENOTE FOR IMAGES, THEY AREN’T POSTED ATM)
    1. Sum the valence electrons from all the atoms. Make sure to add the charge 
        1. $NO_3^{-} \rightarrow 24 \space \space \textnormal {valence electrons}$
    2. Draw the least electronegative atom in the middle with the others evenly spaced around it 
    3. Use a single line to represent a pair of electrons in a bond 
    4. We use dots to represent electrons; arrange the remaining electrons to complete the “octet” for the outside atoms 
    5. Complete the center atom’s octet by creating covalent bonds from lone-pair electrons
